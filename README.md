___/ 10 Attendance during lab, 14-April
___/ 10 Attendance during lab, 21-April
___/ 10 Attendance during lab. 28-April
___/ 10  used AJAX somewhere (we can search for XMLHttpRequest onreadystatechange 
          	and/or verify it is doing some client side processing to change part of a page 
          	without reloading the page
___/ 10 Data base has at least two tables 
___/ 15 At least one join to show results of that join
___/ 15 Can register new accounts
___/ 15 Uses salted hashed passwords in the data base
___/ 15 Requires login to use some additional functionality
___/ 70 must do what is supposed to do (subjective, but matching your proposal)
___/ 20  WOW factor: A normal working project may only get 90% max (subjective).  The project needs to do something to make your TA amazed.  It must be specified through email to your TA. It is likely that the max grade will only be 180/100.  No appeals can be made to your TA or your Instructor for this 10% of the grade.
